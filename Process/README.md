# Mind's Garden Process Blog
Mind's Garden is a first person musical exploration game which reads in audio files to procedurally generate various terrains, characters, and experiences for the player to explore and discover. Every audio file produces a unique playthrough.

## Week 1 - 21 January 2020

Trees, water and splash progress- We have three different types of trees to generate that all take a single variable (which will later be taken from the song itself) and move, rotate, scale, or otherwise change in a way that changes by this single variable being multiplied to pieces of the trees. We also have an edited water shader working and moving as our game's central "sound pond." Multiple particle systems show a splash for dropping any and all sound orbs into the pond. These assets are ready for import into the main project.
