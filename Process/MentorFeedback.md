# Mentor Feedback

TODO: translate this from a list of sentences to some actual paragraphs.

* Ben's first impressions were that he totally gets what our project is all about now and he loves it.
* He thinks that it's in the ideal state for us to be pitching it to a publisher as a prototype right now (if that's what we were doing, but it's not).
* Big takeaway for moving forward: get as much player interaction as you can now where there's big dramatic changes happening
* He thought that the orb follow rate was perfectly fine after the recent tweaks we made this week, no noticable problems at all.
* On the topic of games as gardens: he doesn't see the "cultivation" aspect fitting well into what we've shown him, but adding more interactions/meaningful gameplay choices (i.e. the order that orbs are collectedin matters) could add some garden-y aspects. He generaly views "gardens" in games as the opposite of randomness, and feels like our game plays really well with the random/unexpected vibes.
* Ben really liked how simple our set of controls was, saying it helped it fit into a exhibit/installation enviornment really well where there's a lot of people who are less familiar with games. Sprint and jump controls are maybe not needed, but adding effects to them (if we have time) wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing as long as they aren't vital to enjoying the game.

TODO: get more mentors to give us feedback, I don't think it's the end of the world if nobody gets back to us before the deadline, but it would be ideal.
